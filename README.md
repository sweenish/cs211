# cs211
## Update 7/30/2019
I have for the most part switched to GitLab. Same username. Instead of just code samples, I've actually uploaded my entire lecture contents for CS 311 and CS 400; I am still intermittently making changes to the materials as well. CS 211 will show up at GitLab in the next couple months.

Code samples from my CS 211: Introduction to Programming class at Wichita State University

This repository will hold some of the code samples that I use in class to allow students to review the code to learn syntax and preferred styles.

Not every sample will be uploaded, and some samples may be unique to this repository.
